# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Examples include:
- Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression (price prediction, weather forecasting)

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data:
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

### Reinforcement Learning
The agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Common Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression** - Predicting continuous values
2. **Decision Trees** - Rule-based classification
3. **Neural Networks** - Deep learning models
4. **Support Vector Machines** - Classification with hyperplanes

## Applications

- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
