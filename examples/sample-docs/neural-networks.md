# Neural Networks Deep Dive

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain.

## Architecture

### Layers
- **Input Layer**: Receives the initial data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction

### Activation Functions
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Softmax (for classification)

## Types of Neural Networks

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Best for image processing and computer vision tasks. Uses:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
- Fully connected layers for classification

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequential data like text and time series:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

### Transformers
Modern architecture for NLP:
- Self-attention mechanism
- Parallel processing
- Foundation for models like GPT and BERT

## Training Process

1. Forward propagation
2. Loss calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight updates via gradient descent
