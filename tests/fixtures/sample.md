# Sample Research Document

This is a sample markdown document for testing the RKM CLI ingestion pipeline.

## Overview

This document covers topics related to machine learning, neural networks, and knowledge graphs for testing purposes.

## Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning** - Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning** - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through trial and error

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information.

### Key Components

- Input Layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform data
- Output Layer: Produces the final result

## Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs represent information as a network of entities and their relationships. They enable semantic search and reasoning capabilities.

### Benefits

- Structured representation of knowledge
- Support for complex queries
- Integration of diverse data sources
