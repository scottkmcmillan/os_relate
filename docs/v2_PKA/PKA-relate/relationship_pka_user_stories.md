# User Stories: Relationship Personal Knowledge Assistant (PKA) Mobile App

## Product Vision
A mobile application designed to **develop a piece of the user's personal operating system** focused on relationship management, which in turn helps them **operate their relationships**. It ingests curated content (psychology, neuroscience, relationship dynamics) and acts as an intelligent, **candid** assistant to provide answers, guidance, and proactive management. It evolves with the user through feedback loops, providing **tough love** when necessary rather than just validation.

## Product Goal
To help the user move from reactive (unconscious) emotions to grounded, conscious, value-based action.

## Epics & User Stories

### 1. Content Ingestion & Knowledge Base
*The foundation of the system – gathering the intelligence.*

*   **US-1.1:** As a **Curator**, I want to **share URLs, PDFs, and text snippets** to the app from other mobile apps (browser, reader), so that I can easily build my knowledge base without switching context.
*   **US-1.2:** As a **Learner**, I want the app to **automatically tag and categorize** ingested content (e.g., "Neuroscience", "Conflict Resolution", "Dating Tactics", "Author Name"), so that the information is organized and retrievable.
*   **US-1.3:** As a **User**, I want to **add personal notes** to ingested content, so that I can capture my immediate thoughts or how a specific concept applies to my life.

### 2. Intelligent Q&A & Assistant
*The primary interface – accessing the knowledge.*

*   **US-2.1:** As a **User**, I want to **ask natural language questions** (e.g., "How do I handle a partner who shuts down during conflict?"), so that I can get immediate advice based on my curated library.
*   **US-2.2:** As a **User**, I want the answers to **cite specific sources** from my library, so that I can trust the advice and dive deeper if needed.
*   **US-2.3:** As a **User**, I want the assistant to **synthesize information** from multiple sources (e.g., combining neuroscience with communication tactics), so that I get a comprehensive answer.
*   **US-2.4:** As a **Self-Improver**, I want the assistant to **offer "tough love" and challenge my perspective** when my behavior contradicts healthy relationship principles or my stated goals, avoiding sycophancy so I can genuinely grow (e.g., "Based on [Source], you are actually engaging in protest behavior here").
*   **US-2.5:** As a **User**, I want the system to **actively research public internet sources** (articles, transcripts, podcasts) from specific thought leaders I admire (e.g., "What would Esther Perel say about this?"), even if their content is not yet in my local library, so that I can apply their specific wisdom to my situation.

### 3. Personalization & Evolution (The Feedback Loop)
*The core differentiator – the system learns about the user.*

*   **US-3.1:** As a **User**, I want to **provide feedback** on the advice given (e.g., "This worked", "This felt unnatural"), so that the PKA learns my style and preferences over time.
*   **US-3.2:** As a **Self-Improver**, I want the app to **track my growth areas** (e.g., "Working on active listening"), so that it can tailor future advice to reinforce these goals.
*   **US-3.3:** As a **User**, I want to **log interactions and outcomes** (e.g., "Had a difficult conversation about X, outcome was Y"), so that the PKA can analyze patterns in my behavior and results.
*   **US-3.4:** As a **System**, I want to **detect changes in the user's approach** over time, so that I can update the user's "Psychological Profile" and stop suggesting outdated elementary tactics.
*   **US-3.5:** As a **User**, I want to **explicitly define and articulate my core values and beliefs** across multiple dimensions (e.g., financial, spiritual, family, lifestyle), so that the system can help me stay grounded and true to myself during emotional turbulence.

### 4. Proactive Guidance & Reporting
*Moving from reactive to proactive.*

*   **US-4.1:** As a **User**, I want to receive **"Pre-Game" briefing documents** before important events (e.g., a date, a difficult negotiation), so that I am primed with the right mindset and tactics.
*   **US-4.2:** As a **User**, I want the app to **generate a "Relationship Audit" report** on demand or periodically, summarizing my recent interactions, successful tactics, and areas for improvement.
*   **US-4.3:** As a **Learner**, I want the app to **recommend specific readings** from my library based on my current challenges, so that I can proactively learn what I need right now.
*   **US-4.4:** As a **User**, I want the app to **suggest exercises or reflections**, so that I can practice the theory I've been reading.
*   **US-4.5:** As a **User**, I want the system to **flag inconsistencies** between my desired identity/goals and my actual reported actions without sugarcoating, so I can be held accountable (e.g., "You said you wanted to be less reactive, but you've reported 3 outbursts this week").
*   **US-4.6:** As a **User**, I want the app to **analyze relationships or potential partners** against my defined values to clearly identify **compatibility zones and specific compromises** I am making, ensuring I don't unconsciously abandon my needs.
*   **US-4.7:** As a **User**, I want assistance in **articulating my needs and values** to others (e.g., generating scripts or talking points), so that I can communicate clearly and help them understand my non-negotiables.

### 5. Relationship Management (CRM)
*The tactical application.*

*   **US-5.1:** As a **User**, I want to **maintain profiles for key people** in my life, storing notes about their communication styles, preferences, and our relationship history.
*   **US-5.2:** As a **User**, I want the PKA to **remind me of key facts or past interactions** before I talk to someone, so that I show up as attentive and caring.
*   **US-5.3:** As a **User**, I want to **draft difficult messages** within the app and get critiques/improvements based on my knowledge base (e.g., "Make this more NVC-compliant"), so that I communicate more effectively.

### 6. System Integration
*The "OS" aspect.*

*   **US-6.1:** As a **User**, I want this "Relationship Sub-system" to **respect my privacy and data security** implicitly, keeping my personal reflections and relationship data local or encrypted.
*   **US-6.2:** As a **User**, I want to **export summaries** to my main note-taking app (e.g., Obsidian, Notion), so that my relationship insights are integrated with my broader life OS.
