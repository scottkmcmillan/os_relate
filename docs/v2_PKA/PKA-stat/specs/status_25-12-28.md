  📁 What Was Created

  Backend API (78KB) - Full OpenAPI 3.0 spec with:
  - Authentication (JWT, RBAC)
  - Document management APIs
  - Pyramid of Clarity endpoints
  - Strategic Resonance Engine
  - Market Intelligence APIs
  - WebSocket real-time updates

  Frontend Spec (55KB) - Complete React/Next.js architecture with:
  - Tech stack (React 18, Next.js 14, TypeScript)
  - Role-based dashboards (Leader, Manager, Member)
  - Component library structure
  - State management (React Query + Zustand)
  - Visualization components

  Context exceeded 200K tokens. The swarm was synthesizing too much data.

  To complete remaining specs, you could run targeted commands:
  npx claude-flow@alpha sparc architect "Design PKA-STRAT architecture based on docs/v2_PKA/"
  npx claude-flow@alpha sparc spec "Define data models for PKA-STRAT"
