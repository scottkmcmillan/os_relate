Here is the updated product description for PKA, expanded to include the "Strategic Resonance Engine," a dedicated module for ensuring every micro-action aligns with the macro-vision of the organization.

### **The Strategic Resonance Engine**

**Capability:** Automated Mission Alignment & Strategic Telemetry

**Overview**
PKA-ORG does not just optimize for efficiency; it optimizes for *purpose*. By integrating the **Strategic Resonance Engine**, the system ingests the company's qualitative "North Star" documents (Mission, Vision, OKRs, Market Analysis) and converts them into a quantifiable **Hypergraph** (via **Ruvector**). This allows the system to mathematically measure the "Strategic Distance" between daily operations and long-term goals, alerting leadership to "Mission Drift" before it becomes a quarterly failure.

**Data Input Model: Document-Centric Intelligence**
PKA-ORG operates exclusively through **document ingestion**—the sole interface between the system and organizational knowledge. The system does not access employee emails, calendars, messaging platforms, or other internal company systems. All intelligence is derived from intentionally uploaded documents including:
* Strategic documents (Mission statements, Vision documents, OKRs, Annual Reports)
* Organizational artifacts (Org charts, Role descriptions, Team charters)
* Process documentation (Policies, Procedures, Playbooks)
* Market intelligence reports (Analyst reports, Competitive analyses, Industry white papers)
* Leadership communications (Board decks, All-hands transcripts, Strategic memos)

This deliberate design ensures **data sovereignty**, **privacy compliance**, and **controlled context boundaries** while still enabling comprehensive organizational intelligence.

**Domain Knowledge Acquisition**
Beyond learning from company-specific documents, PKA-ORG continuously builds and refines its understanding of **foundational domain knowledge** in:
* **Organizational Structure Theory** — Team topologies, reporting hierarchies, matrix organizations, networked structures, and emergent organizational patterns
* **Leadership Frameworks** — Situational leadership, servant leadership, transformational leadership models, and executive decision-making patterns
* **Business Management Principles** — Strategic planning methodologies, operational excellence frameworks, change management models, and performance management systems

This domain expertise is embedded in the system's reasoning layer, enabling it to contextualize ingested company documents against established best practices and recognized organizational patterns. When PKA-ORG analyzes a company's org chart, it doesn't just see boxes and lines—it recognizes structural patterns, potential bottlenecks, and opportunities informed by decades of organizational science research.

### **Core Capabilities & Technical Architecture**

#### **1. The "God Agent" Strategy Layer (Hypergraph Alignment)**

* **Objective:** Encode abstract concepts (Vision, Mission) into tangible constraints for agent behavior and employee guidance.
* **Technology:** **Hypergraph Memory** (from the "God Agent" architecture ) + **Ruvector Semantic Embeddings**.


* **Functionality:**
* **Vision-to-Vector Encoding:** PKA-ORG ingests complex strategic documents (e.g., "Become the market leader in sustainable energy") and maps them into a **Causal Hypergraph**. Unlike simple vector search, this structure connects multiple entities simultaneously (e.g., {Product Feature X}  {Q3 Revenue Goal}  {Sustainability Mission}).
* **Mission Drift Detection:** Using **Subpolynomial Dynamic Min-Cut** (`ruvector-mincut`), the system monitors the graph for weak connections between *Current Activity* and *Strategic Objectives*. If a department’s output becomes semantically disconnected from the company vision, the system flags a "Strategic Integrity Warning."
* **Provenance Tracking:** Every tactical recommendation includes an **L-Score (Provenance Metric)** , tracing the decision back to the specific line in the company's mission statement or annual report that justifies it.



#### **2. Market-Aware Policy Optimization (Competitive Adaptation)**

* **Objective:** Dynamically adjust tactics based on real-time market shifts and competitive intelligence.
* **Technology:** **Flow-GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** + **T2 (Agent-Supervised Document Analysis)**.


* **Functionality:**
* **Competitive Intelligence Processing:** PKA-ORG analyzes ingested market intelligence documents—analyst reports, competitive analyses, industry publications, and internally-prepared market research. T2-trained "Market Analyst" agents extract insights from these uploaded documents to build a continuously-updated competitive landscape model.
* **Tactical Re-weighting:** When market intelligence documents indicate strategic shifts (e.g., a competitor's pricing change noted in an analyst report), PKA-ORG uses **Flow-GRPO** to simulate thousands of strategic responses (e.g., "Match price" vs. "Highlight quality"). It calculates the expected reward not just in revenue, but in **Strategic Alignment**—favoring moves that preserve the brand's long-term vision over short-term panic.
* **Simulation-Based Wargaming:** Leaders can run "What-If" scenarios (e.g., "If we pivot to Enterprise Sales, how does that impact our 'User-First' mission?"). The system generates counterfactual reasoning chains to predict cultural and operational friction, informed by both company documents and embedded domain knowledge of organizational change patterns.


#### **3. Automated Strategic Framework Recommendation**

* **Objective:** Prescribe specific leadership frameworks (e.g., Agile, Lean, Team Topologies) based on the organization's unique topology.
* **Technology:** **ReasoningBank** (Pattern Storage)  + **SAFLA Meta-Cognition**.


* **Functionality:**
* **Framework Matching:** By analyzing the **Topological Org-Chart** (Section 1), PKA-ORG identifies the company's working style. If it detects highly coupled teams with high communication latency, it might recommend moving to a **"Reverse Conway Maneuver"** structure.
* **Alignment Tactics:** It auto-generates **SPARC** implementations for strategic initiatives. For example, if the goal is "Innovation," it generates a specific "20% Time" policy protocol, complete with agentic monitoring to ensure it isn't consumed by busy work.
* **Cultural Reinforcement via RLVR:** The system creates a custom Reward Function for the internal agents. If the company values "Speed," agents are rewarded for lower latency. If it values "Accuracy," they are rewarded for extensive verification. This aligns the *synthetic workforce* with the *human culture*.



### **Updated User Experience**

* **The "Strategic Alignment Map":** A heat-map overlay on the Org-Chart. Teams glowing "Green" are highly aligned with the Mission Vectors. Teams glowing "Red" are drifting—producing work that doesn't semantically map to any active company objective.
* **The "Board-Level" Narrative Generator:** PKA-ORG can draft Board Decks that mathematically prove alignment. *"We executed Initiative X, which increased our Topological Connectivity by 15% and reduced Strategic Drift by 22%, directly supporting Vision Statement Paragraph 3."*

### **Summary of Value Proposition**

PKA-ORG transforms "Strategic Alignment" from a vague HR buzzword into a **computable metric**. By combining **Ruvector's Hypergraphs** to model the *complexity* of the mission and **Flow-GRPO** to optimize the *execution* of that mission, it ensures that the organization moves as a single, coherent organism, self-correcting in real-time against the "True North" of its leadership vision.
